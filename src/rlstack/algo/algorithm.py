class Algorithm:
    """An optimized PPO (https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.06347.pdf) algorithm
    with common tricks for stabilizing and accelerating learning.

    This algorithm assumes environments are parallelized much like
    IsaacGym environments (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.10470.pdf) and
    are infinite horizon with no terminal conditions. These assumptions
    allow the learning procedure to occur extremely fast even for
    complex, sequence-based models because:
        1) environments occur in parallel and are batched into a contingous
            buffer
        2) all environments are reset in parallel after a predetermined
            horizon is reached
        3) and all operations occur on the same device, removing overhead
            associated with data transfers between devices

    Args:
        env_cls: Highly parallelized environment for sampling experiences.
            Instantiated with `env_config`. Will be stepped for `horizon`
            each `collect` call.
        env_config: Initial environment config passed to `env_cls` for the
            environment instantiation. This is likely to be overwritten
            on the environment instance if reset with a new config.
        model_cls: Optional custom policy model definition. A model class
            is provided for you based on the environment instance's specs
            if you don't provide one. Defaults to a simple feedforward
            neural network.
        model_config: Optional policy model config unpacked into the model
            during instantiation.
        dist_cls: Custom policy action distribution class. An action
            distribution class is provided for you based on the environment
            instance's specs. Defaults to a categorical action distribution
            for discrete actions and a gaussian action distribution for
            continuous actions. Complex actions are not supported for default
            action distributions.
        horizon: Number of environment transitions to collect during `collect`.
            The environment is reset based on `horizons_per_reset`. The
            buffer's size is [B, T] where T is `horizon`.
        horizons_per_reset: Number of times `collect` can be called before
            resetting `env`. Set this to a higher number if you want learning
            to occur across horizons. Leave this as the default `1` if it
            doesn't matter that experiences and learning only occurs within
            one horizon.
        num_envs: Number of parallelized simulation environments for the
            environment instance. Passed during the environment's
            instantiation. The buffer's size is [B, T] where B is `num_envs`.
        optimizer_cls: Custom optimizer class. Defaults to an optimizer
            that doesn't require much tuning.
        optimizer_config: Custom optimizer config unpacked into `optimizer_cls`
            during optimizer instantiation.
        lr_schedule: Optional schedule that overrides the optimizer's learning rate.
            This deternmines the value of the learning rate according to the
            number of environment transitions experienced during learning.
            The learning rate is constant if this isn't provided.
        lr_schedule_kind: Kind of learning rate scheduler to use if `lr_schedule`
            is provided. Options include:
                - "step": jump to values and hold until a new environment transition
                    count is reached.
                - "interp": jump to values like "step", but interpolate between the
                    current value and the next value.
        entropy_coeff: Entropy coefficient value. Weight of the entropy loss w.r.t.
            other components of total loss. This value is ignored if
            `entropy_coeff_schedule` is provded.
        entropy_coeff_schedule: Optional schedule that overrides `entropy_coeff`. This
            determines values of `entropy_coeff` according to the number of environment
            transitions experienced during learning.
        entropy_coeff_schedule_kind: Kind of entropy scheduler to use. Options include:
            - "step": jump to values and hold until a new environment transition
                count is reached.
            - "interp": jump to values like "step", but interpolate between the
                current value and the next value.
        gae_lambda: Generalized Advantage Estimation (GAE) hyperparameter for controlling
            the variance and bias tradeoff when estimating the state value
            function from collected environment transitions. A higher value
            allows higher variance while a lower value allows higher bias
            estimation but lower variance.
        gamma: Discount reward factor often used in the Bellman operator for
            controlling the variance and bias tradeoff in collected experienced
            rewards. Note, this does not control the bias/variance of the
            state value estimation and only controls the weight future rewards
            have on the total discounted return.
        sgd_minibatch_size: PPO hyperparameter indicating the minibatc size `buffer`
            is split into when updating the policy's model in `step`. It's usually best to
            maximize the minibatch size to reduce the variance associated with
            updating the policy's model, but also accelerate the computations
            when learning (assuming a CUDA device is being used). If `None`,
            the whole buffer is treated as one giant batch.
        num_sgd_iter: PPO hyperparameter indicating the number of gradient steps to take
            with the whole `buffer` when calling `step`.
        shuffle_minibatches: Whether to shuffle minibatches within `step`.
            Recommended, but not necessary if the minibatch size is large enough
            (e.g., the buffer is the batch).
        clip_param: PPO hyperparameter indicating the max distance the policy can
            update away from previously collected policy sample data with
            respect to likelihoods of taking actions conditioned on
            observations. This is the main innovation of PPO.
        vf_clip_param: PPO hyperparameter similar to `clip_param` but for the
            value function estimate. A measure of max distance the model's
            value function is allowed to update away from previous value function
            samples.
        kl_coeff: KL divergence loss coefficient that weighs KL divergence loss w.r.t.
            other loss components. KL divergence loss is ignored and not computed
            unless this is `> 0`. This is updated to make the mean KL divergence loss
            be close to `kl_target`. If the mean KL divergence is higher than `target`,
            then `coeff` is increased to increase the weight of the KL divergence
            in the loss, thus decreasing subsequent sampled mean KL divergence losses.
        kl_target: Target KL divergence. The desired distance between new and old
            policies. Used for updating `kl_coeff`.
        vf_coeff: PPO hyperparameter similar to `clip_param` but for the value function
            estimate. A measure of max distance the model's value function is
            allowed to update away from previous value function samples.
        max_grad_norm: Max gradient norm allowed when updating the policy's model
            within `step`.
        device: Device the `env`, `buffer`, and `policy` all reside on.
